three files are included in sql along with READE.txt

create_tables.sql creates a table for all the Data Models.  Each table contains slots for the required info.

import_data.sh imports the data files with curl, unzips the file, and runs a python program

pythonsort.py  is supposed to read the files that were just downloaded in sql/osnap_legacy, sort them, then put the data into the tables.
               It tries to run python on the VM and fails, need to correct this.
