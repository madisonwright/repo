app.py- the app that controls which the url addresses and responses to those addresses.  Also sends user input data.
        Have not managed to acheive stable drop down menus that pick data from the database properly.  As of now, the 
        user must input the psql commands manually in the submit bar to get the desired data.  Once that is working
        and the error screen, I should have the project requirements.
config.py and lost_config.json- Manual configuration files, if working properly, it should display on the login screen
temmplates:
login.html-displays the login screen, button takes you to the report filter screen.
rfs.html-displays the report filter screen, login name from the previous redirect and two button sections for user input
fir.html and itr.html-skeleton for these are the same, both display information fromt he database and include a logout button
logout.html- logout screen, contains button to redirect to the login screen.

500.html-work in progress error screen, still figuring out how to handle errors to redirect to the login screen
