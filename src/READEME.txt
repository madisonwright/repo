This is my README file.
Why Src2? because I'm an idot. I did something weird to src, failed to correct it and abandoned ship.

Wsgi:
  app.py -holds the routs for the stubs
  config.py, lost_config.json -same as last time, configurations files

templates:
  hole the templates html files for the urls

clients:
  actiate/suspend_user -stubs for activating and suspending the user, 1 arg
  list_products -lists if your argument is in a table.  since my tables are empt  y, my stub says that every query has no match
  lits_products/assets -take 4 args and list them back in json format


my code this week is largely based on the sample code. As far as I can tell, that's what we're supposed to do, and it's easier than past weeks.  I also seem to believe that the preflight.sh is also no longer needed, since these are stubs and therefor do not connect to the database.
